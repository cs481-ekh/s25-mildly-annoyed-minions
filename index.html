        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Innovation plays a critical role in economic growth, and research and development (R&D) labs have
            historically been at the forefront of major technological advancements. However, valuable data on U.S.
            research and development labs from 1975-1998 contained in notable directories of the time remain largely
            inaccessible due to their printed format. This project aims to digitize and process these directories,
            transforming them into a structured, digital dataset suitable for economic data analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our solution involves developing a program based on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract and clean
            key attributes from scanned directories, standardizing information such as lab names, locations, research
            fields, and parent companies. Once digitized, the data will be optimized for longitudinal analysis and
            integration with other datasets, enabling future research into the role of these R&D labs in innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The potential impact is significant: researchers will gain access to a comprehensive dataset, allowing for
            new insights into the historical relationship between corporate R&D efforts and technological progress.
            Additionally, the project will deliver a functional data-processing tool, ensuring sustainability for
            future digitization efforts.

        <h2>What We Actually Built</h2>
        <p>
            The program that we've created consists of a graphical user interface (GUI) built with
            <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html" target="_blank">Tkinter</a> where users can upload
            files, select the ones they want to extract using our program and receive a structured CSV output of the PDF.
        </p>
        <div class="image-row">
            <img src="assets/no-selected.png" alt="GUI with files but none selected." class="responsive"/>
            <img src="assets/some-selected.png" alt="GUI with some files selected." class="responsive" />
        </div>
        <p>
            In its current state, our program doesn't handle all the entries correctly. Most entries are parsed
            properly but, entries that are read with inconsistent spacing, extra information, or incomplete information
            aren't able to extracted properly. All the information that isn't able to be parsed properly gets placed
            in the "miscellaneous" column.
        </p>
        <p>
            The input documents are pre-processed using the <a href="https://opencv.org" target="_blank">OpenCV</a>
            image processing library in which we enhance the image clarity as much as possible and draw boxes around
            entries so that the OCR engine is able to determine groups of text properly. The OCR Engine that we utilized
            is <a href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract" target="_blank">Tesseract</a> OCR Engine as it is
            one of the best free, open-source OCR Engine of today. We decided to go with Tesseract because it is well
            known as a great OCR Engine, accessible, easy to use due to the pytesseract library, and is computationally
            efficient in comparison to some of the transformer based models that are out there today.
        </p>
        <p>
            After pre-processing, files are run through Tesseract to produce blocks of raw text, each block
            corresponding to a single entry. These blocks are then run through our custom parser to extract fields
            before getting written out to a CSV file.
